        I&apos;m a software engineer who loves to create intuitive interfaces
        and build out features across the stack. I value:
        <ul>
          <li>
            well-documented and efficient processes that offer both structure
            and flexibility
          </li>
          <li>clear and kind communication</li>
          <li>cross-functional collaboration</li>
          <li>
            supportive environments that foster diversity and nurture growth
          </li>
        </ul>
        Optimism guides my efforts while practicality ensures that my goals are
        brought to fruition, and helping others brings me great joy.
